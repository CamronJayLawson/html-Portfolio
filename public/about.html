<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Camron Lawson. I'm very excited to start this journey of becoming a
  web developer. <br />
  I've had an intrest in computer, science and coding for about six years now.
  <br />
  I think it's time to try to become a Web developer. <br />
  I've graduated high school in June 2021 and am planning for a career in
  computer science.
